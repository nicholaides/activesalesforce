== Welcome to Active Salesforce

  ActiveSalesforce is an extension to the Rails Framework that allows for the dynamic creation and management of 
  ActiveRecord objects through the use of Salesforce meta-data and uses a Salesforce.com organization as the backing store.


== Getting started

1. gem install activesalesforce
2. if you have not already done so generate your initial rails app using "rails <myappname goes here>" 
3. edit config/environment.rb and add "require_gem 'activesalesforce'" to the end of the "Rails::Initializer.run do |config|" block, e.g.

		Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
		  ...
		  
		  require 'activesalesforce'
		end

4. edit database.yml

		adapter: activesalesforce
  		url: https://www.salesforce.com
  		username: <salesforce user name goes here>
  		password: <salesforce password goes here>
  		
  		NOTE: If you want to access your Salesforce Sandbox account use https://test.salesforce.com as your url instead
  		
5. proceed using standard Rails development techniques!  	

== Advanced Features

  1. Session ID based Authentication: Add the following to /app/controllers/application.rb to enable SID auth for all controllers
  
  		class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  			before_filter ActiveSalesforce::SessionIDAuthenticationFilter
		end
		
  2. Boxcar'ing of updates, inserts, and deletes. Use <YourModel>.transaction() to demark boxcar boundaries.
